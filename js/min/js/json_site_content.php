(MDMNKY) was originally formed by 3 (nigerian-born) friends. They are products of expatriate families&mdash;traveling away from their native homes to find opportunity overseas. During their stay in the Netherlands, they were bonded by the love of robots, eclectic music, and a common philosophy that: &quot;there is something more to life&quot;. After leaving the mother land to find opportunity, we are learning that true satisfaction comes from being a conduit of this the said opportunity. Regardless of your origin - one has to take this opportunity to where they came from, or to where it is absent.</p><p>We want to stir a generation in the (self-imposed) diaspora. A diaspora triggered by the quest for knowledge. A quest which has taken the brightest and best away from communities which are in dire need of their cognitive, physical and emotional giftings. We want to start a movement that encourages the knowledge-seekers to return and/or give back! Many of us get comfortable in our new dwellings, we enjoy the stimulants of the new environment - and we are kept in the newness by a stigma of the old. A stigma that insists that we will become corrupted, used, and ruined by the old. This stigma is reinforced by tales in the media about the deterioration of what we used to know, memories all of a sudden seem like fairly tales.</p><p>MDMNKY says NO to the status quo! Gone are the days where we chase a promise, overcome the obstacles, blazing trails along the way only to arrive with no plans to ever return. Like an explorer finding new worlds only to never return and share the discovery. MDMNKY says we can, indeed, affect change. We are not naive. Alone, all our fears will be realized, but together, our dreams can come true. We dream of a place where nepotism is unknown, where your ability reinforces your credibility, where dignity is not compromised and where accountability to one another becomes a deterrent from one being defrauded.</p><p>Yes, this is a BIG BIG idea. How do we influence a generation of highly educated, skilled and strong-willed individuals to give[go] back? We hope to appeal to the intrinsic &quot;tug&quot;. As if to say: your fairy-tale memories of back-home were tangible experiences that we all shared. Remember this and this or that and that? Substitute Nigeria with Russia, or down-south Mississippi, or New Orleans, or Israel, or Kenya and you see how the concept is globally applicable. This is the appeal of Mad Monkey.</p><p>Mad Monkey is a metaphor. A metaphor in response to complacency, selfishness, empire-building and laziness.</p><p> Won't you join us!</p>",bottom_nav:'<a href="http://cargocollective.com/blakrobot" target="_blank">Obi</a> | <a href="http://dbala.com" target="_blank">Bala</a> | Gbenro'}]}]};
